# Data Structure and Contents

This directory contains two main subdirectories:

1. **raw**: This directory will contain the raw sensor data files, either synthetic or sourced from public datasets. The raw data should be in a format suitable for processing, such as CSV or JSON.

2. **processed**: This directory will store the preprocessed sensor data that is ready for model training and evaluation. The preprocessed data should be cleaned, normalized, and structured in a way that is compatible with the models used in this project.
